## Welcome! 

PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 432 is the second half ([431 is the first half](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/)) of a two-semester course taught by Professor Thomas Love in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. 

If you have any questions before class begins, contact Dr. Love at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`. Once the class starts, visit the [Contact Us](contact.qmd) page to learn more about how to get help from us.

## Getting Started

Your first six steps in this course are to:

    - Section 1 of PQHS 432, CRSP 432 and MPHP 432 are identical.
2. Review this [course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/), and be sure to visit the [Course Calendar](calendar.qmd), and skim through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2024/).
3. You need to buy Jeff Leek's **How to be a Modern Scientist**, available electronically through <https://leanpub.com/modernscientist>. The suggested cost is $10, but you can pay what you want.
4. Please fill out the [Welcome to 432 Survey](https://bit.ly/432-2024-welcome-survey) at <https://bit.ly/432-2024-welcome-survey> to help us get to know you a little better. Note that you must **log into Google via your CWRU account** in order to access the survey, which should take about 10 minutes to complete.
