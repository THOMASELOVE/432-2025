## How do I get help?

This is an open book, open notes quiz. You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website and that we've been reading in the class, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants. You will complete a short affirmation that you have obeyed these rules as part of submitting the Quiz.

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly two ways of getting help:

- You can ask your question via email to **Thomas dot Love at case dot edu**, or
- You can ask your question of Dr. Love directly in class 15 on 2025-03-04.

During the Quiz period (2024-02-27 through 2024-03-05) we will not answer questions about Quiz 1 except through the email and class session above. 

- Please check your email **and** the [Quiz 1 links page](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/quiz1.html) *before* submitting the final version of your Quiz, to see if Dr. Love has posted any changes there. 
- Dr. Love promises to respond to all questions received before 9 AM on 2024-03-05 (three hours before the Quiz is due) in a timely fashion.
