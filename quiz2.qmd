4. To save you some typing, we have also provided Quarto and HTML versions of a document called **starting_quiz_2**. To download the files, visit the **432 Quiz 2 Materials (due 2025-04-28 at 9 AM)** folder on our Shared Drive. This document provides the following code elements (also provided in the main document PDF):
    - the complete setup (R packages, etc.) used by Professor Love to build the quiz and its answer sketch,
    - all code necessary to download the six data sets to create the tibbles used in the quiz, and
    - some of the code necessary to complete Question 9

We suggest you use the **starting_quiz_2** Quarto file to get started developing answers for the Quiz questions. The HTML version is provided so that you can see what the results of using the Quarto file should look like before you answer any of the questions.

## Other Details on Quiz 2

Quiz 2 covers materials from Classes 1-23 of the course, as well as Jeff Leek's [How to be a modern scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), and other sources assigned during classes 1-23.

Again, Quiz 2 is due at 9 AM on Monday 2025-04-28. The Google Form will close at 9:30 AM that day, and will not re-open, so you have 30 minutes leeway.
