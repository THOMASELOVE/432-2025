<section id="project-b-overview" class="level1">
<h1>Project B Overview</h1>
<p>In project B, you will create two research questions that can be addressed with data you can conveniently obtain that can be used to address each of your questions, with models that you learned in the 431-432 sequence.</p>
<p>You will fit one regression model for each research question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of your models must include 2-8 predictors.</li>
<li>Each model must include at least one predictor that is not included in the other model.</li>
<li>Each model will need to describe observations from the same pool of “subjects”, so that a single tibble services the whole Project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model for your first outcome must be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>A model for a multi-categorical outcome (with 3-7 levels)</li>
<li>A model for a count outcome, or</li>
<li>A Cox model for a time-to-event outcome with censoring</li>
</ul>
<p>The model for your second outcome must use a different approach than you used for Outcome 1. For this model, you can use any of the three options above, or you may use:</p>
<ul>
<li>A linear or binary logistic model fit using a Bayesian engine, or</li>
<li>A linear or binary logistic model fit by selecting candidate predictors using a best subsets procedure, or</li>
<li>A linear regression model that uses survey weights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Use at least 3 predictors (and still no more than 8) if you are fitting a linear or binary logistic model for your second outcome, please.</p>
<section id="deliverables" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>There are three deliverables in Project B: a Proposal Form, an in-person or Zoom Presentation, a Portfolio developed with Quarto (<a href="#submitting-your-data">along with your Data</a>).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Proposal Form</strong> By the deadline on the <a href="./calendar.html">Calendar</a> in early April, you will submit a Google Form that Dr.&nbsp;Love will make available at <a href="https://bit.ly/432-2025-projB-proposal" class="uri">https://bit.ly/432-2025-projB-proposal</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this form, you will specify your title, your research questions, and your data source, and whether or not you are working with a partner.</li>
<li>You will also provide a brief description of each of your outcomes, and the type of models you plan to fit.</li>
<li>Finally, you will also specify the times that work for you (and your partner) to give your Project B presentation to Professor Love.</li>
<li>We will need to approve your Proposal Form before you proceed further, and this may require some revisions to your plan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Presentation</strong> After receiving our approval of your submitted proposal form, you will prepare a portfolio of your results with Quarto (<a href="#template-for-the-portfolio">a template is available</a> for this), and then present your work to Professor Love. The schedule for these presentations will be determined after completion of the Project B Proposal Form.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Portfolio and Data</strong> You will then make changes (as needed) to your Quarto document (portfolio) in response to Professor Love’s comments during your presentation, and submit the final version of the portfolio along with a version of your data (<a href="#submitting-your-data">as described here</a>) to <a href="https:://canvas.case.edu">Canvas</a> by the deadline in the <a href="./calendar.html">Calendar</a>. At this time, <strong>you should also submit the slides</strong> you used in your presentation (please submit them as you presented them - without updates) through Canvas, assuming you built slides for your presentation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Materials you should submit to Canvas by NOON on 2025-04-30 are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Your Quarto file for the project</li>
<li>An HTML file that is the result of rendering your Quarto file</li>
<li>An .Rds data file (either the real data if publically available, or a five-row pseudo-data set if not - see Instructions for details)</li>
<li>The Slides (assuming you made slides) for your Project B presentation</li>
</ol>
<section id="working-with-a-partner" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-with-a-partner">Working with a Partner?</h3>
<p>You can choose either to work alone, or with one other person, to complete Project B, unless Professor Love has specifically requested that you work alone. He will make those requests after Project A’s grading is complete.</p>
<p>If you are working with a partner…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>exactly one</strong> of you needs to complete the <a href="https://bit.ly/432-2025-projB-proposal">Project B Proposal Form</a> (the other student should <strong>send an email to Dr.&nbsp;Love with the subject line 432 Project B Partnership</strong> confirming that you are working in a partnership and telling me the name of your partner), then</li>

<h1>Need Help?</h1>
<p>Questions about Project B may be directed to the TAs and to Professor Love at any time <strong>after</strong> your submission of the Project A portfolio. If you’re asking a question <a href="https://campuswire.com/">on Campuswire</a>, please use the <code>Project B</code> label, and we encourage you to ask general questions in public rather than privately, so as to get help from other students, and provide help to them.</p>

<h1>General Advice</h1>
<section id="on-research-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-research-questions">On Research Questions</h2>
<p>Project B requires you to answer two research questions with data you obtain. You can study any question you like, although I’d steer clear of anything that you think Professor Love might find inappropriate. All of the <a href="./projA.html#my-first-research-question">advice from Project A</a> on this subject still holds. Each of your research questions needs to lead clearly to a modeling strategy, where you’ll fit an appropriate regression model.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-selecting-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-selecting-data">On Selecting Data</h2>
<p>We hope that most people will find datasets of interest to them and use those. If you do not have any strong ideas for data to use, then we encourage you to consider the <a href="./projA.html#good-data-sets-to-use">suggestions from 432 Project A</a>. The best projects from my perspective use interesting and appropriate data that we have never seen before.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You must completely identify the source(s) of the data, so that Professor Love understands what data you are using very well, but you will not be required to share the data with him, or anyone else, if the data you use are not already available to the public. You must ensure that you have all necessary permission(s) to use the data for this course project.</li>
<li>Each of your models must work with data drawn from the same tibble, and describe observations from the same pool of “subjects”.</li>
<li>We prefer that data sets contain between 200 and 2000 complete observations on each outcome, but you can use more than 2000 or as few as 150, if it’s important to do so. Projects with less than 150 subjects with complete data on all variables are not acceptable for Project B.</li>
<li>Your tibble will need a subject identifying code, and each model must have a separate outcome, and at least one predictor not used in the other model and each model must have 2-8 predictors, we anticipate that your clean, tidied tibble will include between 6 and 19 variables.</li>
<li>We suggest that you collapse multiple categories as necessary to ensure that you have at least 25 observations in every category you plan to use for every predictor or outcome studied in Project B.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike 432 Project A, NHANES data are a completely acceptable choice for Project B, although we do require you to use the demographics file and at least two other NHANES files in developing your data set. If you use NHANES data or other large (weighted) survey data, you are welcome to do any or all of Project B without incorporating sampling weights.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We have had some difficulty identifying data set suggestions (outside of educational repositories like the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>) that are both messy enough to be interesting for this project and which also provide time-to-event outcomes with right censoring that are suitable for the survival analysis work we discuss in 432. If you have suggestions along these lines, we would be eager to hear them.</p>

<li>You are not allowed to use data Professor Love or anyone else has provided to you for teaching purposes.</li>
<li>You cannot reuse the data you used in Project A for 432, although you can use a different data set to answer related questions. You are welcome to reuse data you used in your 431 project work if it is suitable and you haven’t used it in Project A for 432.</li>

<p>On the basis of your responses to <a href="https://bit.ly/432-2025-projB-proposal">the Proposal Form</a>, we will either approve or reject your Project B plan, and once it is approved, you can proceed.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we cannot approve your project, we’ll tell you why, and tell you how to try again. You’ll need to iterate until we approve your project, but we hope this won’t require more than two tries for anyone.</li>
<li>The main reason why we don’t approve projects is that we don’t understand the description of your data set or its outcomes, your planned modeling approaches, or how the research questions link to the available data, so focus on making those connections as clear as possible.</li>
<li>TAs are available during their office hours to review your planned research questions, data set and planned variables with you to make suggestions.</li>

<p>No plan survives first contact with the data unscathed. You will wind up making changes as your work on the Project progresses. Once we approve your proposed research questions, you should feel to free to make any change you like, so long as you are not materially changing the general topic of your work. If you feel that you need to change the title or one of the outcomes in your project, that’s the time to run the changes past Professor Love in an email, but if the original title and outcomes still work, you’ll be fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you do need to change a title, request a re-approval via email by submitting both the initial title and research questions as well as the new ones you now propose, accompanied by a brief description of what needs to change and why you need to make the change.</li>
<li>Professor Love will consider changes of this sort via email he receives more than 72 hours prior to your scheduled project presentation. After that, your title is locked in.</li>
<li>You do not need permission to adjust your choice of variables, or your strategy for including subjects or anything else that wouldn’t change the main goals of your project or your title.</li>

<section id="the-presentation" class="level1">
<h1>The Presentation</h1>
<p>After you register your project and obtain a presentation time, your remaining job is to build a very well-designed and well-analyzed study then present it to Professor Love (orally and in your Portfolio document) beautifully.</p>
<p>Some presentations will be given in person and others via Zoom. In either case, your presentation is based on results contained in your portfolio, hitting on these four key points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What your research questions were and why they are important.</li>
<li>What data you used and why it was relevant to addressing your questions.
<ul>
<li>You should present at least two effective visualizations of your data that help Professor Love understand what can be said about your research questions, at least one of which should help Professor Love explore your data, and at least one of which should help Professor Love evaluate the success of a particular model. Build the presentation around the figures!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What statistical methods you used to analyze and model the data and why they were appropriate.
<ul>
<li>In particular, you are required to present at least one result that is derived from one of your regression models. Your model(s) should be clearly linked to your eventual conclusions about your research questions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What the results say about your research questions - what you have learned by doing this project?
<ul>
<li>Be as clear as possible in your speaking about how you address each of the four main issues specified above.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Jeff Leek’s best piece of advice in my opinion is to make the <strong>FIGURES</strong> the focus of your writing and your presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another good piece of advice is to acknowledge the work of others appropriately (especially in highlighting where the data come from.) Be gracious.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your presentation should be focused on your demonstration of your understanding of key ideas from the course. Do not spend more than the minimum possible time discussing the background of your data or your data cleaning. Focus on your research questions, your analytic work, and your discussion of conclusions, effect sizes and limitations.</p>
<p>You should think of this as no more than a 15 minute presentation if no one asked any questions, but the time slots are 20 minutes each because Professor Love will ask questions of you, during and after your presentation. Professor Love will ask all kinds of things in an effort to allow you to show your best thinking and to make sure you understand and can explain the things you’re presenting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your ability to address those questions effectively, using the results from your portfolio of work, is the thing that will separate mediocre grades from excellent ones, in most cases.</li>
<li>You will need to be agile in responding to me. Anticipate tough questions. Professor Love will be looking for clear answers, motivated by your results.</li>
<li>Rehearse your presentation so that it takes 12-15 minutes if no one asks you any questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work as a team, Professor Love will pick one of you at random, on the spot, to deliver the first half of the presentation, and the other will do the second half. Professor Love will address questions to each of you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-plan a place where whoever Professor Love chooses to speak first will switch off to the second person so that the time is about even, and you’ll both need to be prepared to give either half of the presentation.</li>
<li>If you’re on Zoom, one of you should plan to be the one who will share their screen for both halves of the presentation, so we don’t have to switch back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can give your presentation using just your knitted HTML results from Quarto, or a set of slides you’ve prepared or any other tools that allow you to show your mastery of 432 material most effectively in the available time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not plan to run R code during the session. Your HTML file, for example, must be completely knitted.</li>
<li>Structure your presentation so you can find things very easily. Useful names in the headers help, certainly, but thoughtful construction of an argument and good NAMES for things in your code, and in the headings of your presentation is really the most important thing.</li>
</ul>
<section id="p-values-and-statistical-significance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="p-values-and-statistical-significance">P values and “statistical significance”</h2>
<p>As in Project A, you are welcome to include p values in your analyses in either the portfolio or the presentation, but you should demonstrate good statistical practice by not comparing them to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> levels to declare things to be important, meaningful, or significant.</p>
<p><strong>You should not use the words “statistically significant” or any synonyms (like statistically detectable) in any of your materials or in your presentation.</strong></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-project-portfolio" class="level1">
<h1>The Project Portfolio</h1>
<p>You will build a <strong>written portfolio</strong> created using Quarto of Project B materials. Your portfolio should present your work in a way that allows you to demonstrate to Professor Love your mastery of several important ideas you learned during the 432 class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your portfolio will include some background, leading into your research question or questions, your data management work and codebook, and then your analytic work, data descriptions, results and conclusions.</li>
<li>Your portfolio should demonstrate your commitment to replicable research by presenting a description of your work that allows you (or anyone else with access to the raw data) to review and repeat and (potentially) modify all of your important work by following your presentation.</li>
<li>Your goal in the portfolio should be to ensure that you, two years from now, can use your portfolio and the data to replicate your work and make changes in light of new information easily.</li>
</ul>
<section id="template-for-the-portfolio" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="template-for-the-portfolio">Template for the Portfolio</h2>
<p>Professor Love built a sample template for the Project B Portfolio, and we strongly encourage you to use it. This template is posted to our <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data">432-data site</a>.</p>
<p>Any alternate template or formatting style is acceptable if it is built using Quarto and contains all of the section headings in Professor Love’s template. The list of HTML “themes” that are available in Quarto by changing the “theme” option in the start of your document <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html">can be found here</a> and we encourage you to pick something you think looks nice.</p>

<li>Data Ingest and Management</li>
<li>Code Book and Description</li>
<li>Analysis 1</li>
<li>Analysis 2</li>
<li>Conclusions and Discussion</li>
<li>References and Acknowledgments</li>
<li>Session Information</li>
</ol>
<p>Make your portfolio gorgeous, thoughtful and incredibly easy for Professor Love to use in evaluating your work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Leek’s material in <a href="https://leanpub.com/modernscientist">How To Be a Modern Scientist</a> is very useful here, in particular the material on Scientific Talks and on Paper Writing. We especially like the advice to write clearly and simply.</li>
<li>Include all R code and output that you need to help Professor Love understand the important issues in your study.
<ul>
<li>Adding <strong>more</strong> material, just for the sake of demonstrating that you can, is a good way for me to be <strong>unimpressed</strong> with your project. If you cannot think of anything to say about a piece of output easily, why are you including it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cleaning the data is a vitally important step. Professor Love will assume that you have done it perfectly. The TAs can help you, but this is your responsibility.</li>
<li>Your cleaning should use tools from the tidyverse when possible, and you should do all analytic work on tibbles, whenever possible.</li>
<li>Don’t include warnings or messages from R that we don’t need to know about. Use and trust your judgment.</li>
<li>Never show long versions of output when short ones will do. A particularly good idea is to print a tibble rather than showing an entire data set.</li>

<p>Review your HTML output file carefully before submission for copy-editing issues (spelling, grammar and syntax.)

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submitting-your-data">Submitting Your Data</h2>
<p>If your data are <strong>available to the public</strong>, including Professor Love, then submit (along with your final portfolio):</p>
<ul>
<li>whatever Professor Love needs to provide to the Quarto file to ingest your data (this is most commonly a .csv file or series of them, but you might instead pull directly from the internet, which is also fine.)</li>
<li>a tidied version of the data set, saved as .Rds, and matching precisely what you describe in your codebook.</li>
<li>if the data are available online, you must provide within your HTML file a working URL with instructions to access the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your data are <strong>not available to the public</strong>, then submit (again, with your Portfolio):</p>
<ul>
<li>an .Rds or .csv file consisting of five rows of your data, with all variables included in your codebook provided, and with different values of each of the variables displayed.</li>
<li>The five rows can be five actual rows from your data set, or each row can take parts of several different actual rows in your data to hide details and prevent re-identification.</li>

These constraints are meant to stop you from doing that.</p>

<li>Use multiple imputation to deal with missing values in presenting a final model for either a linear or logistic regression whenever possible.</li>
<li>Be sure to explicitly state the assumptions you make about the missing data mechanism.</li>
<li>You may use single imputation in the process of developing your models, in presenting residual plots for linear models, or in presenting final models for regression approaches for count, multi-categorical or time-to-event with censoring outcomes.</li>

These df limits include the intercept term(s).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you are fitting a regression to a <strong>quantitative or count</strong> outcome, let <em>n</em> = sample size. For this count and all of the counts here, do not include any data points where the outcome is missing.</li>
<li>If you are fitting a regression to a <strong>categorical</strong> outcome, let <em>n</em> = # of observations in the category with the smallest sample size.</li>

<li><p>If you choose to use a spline or polynomial function with a quantitative predictor and want also to use an interaction term for that predictor, be sure to restrict the interaction to a linear term only with <code>%ia%</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that the coefficients and standard errors in your models don’t explode, which can happen when a predictor overwhelms the regression model.

<p>No.&nbsp;You’ll want to have some of that information at your fingertips in a presentation, so think carefully about what to keep and what to drop. Clearly, there is meaningful overlap (you need to describe your research questions, your data, provide a codebook, etc.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What should we name models, and variables?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something memorable and consistent. If you want to avoid creativity, then call things <code>model_01</code> and <code>model_02</code>, by all means, but do that in both the text descriptions and in your code. Don’t call the same thing Model 1 (or my first model) in your text, but <code>mod_1</code> in your code, as an example.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Is there an advantage to choosing a public (open, sharable) data set over a private one for this Project?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are permitted to do either. A substantial advantage of public data is that you can share the details with us (including the data) if you encounter a coding problem. This improves the chances that we can be helpful.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Should we consider larger data sets with substantially more than 2,000 observations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to work with a huge data set, then we encourage you to sample it down to at most 2,000 observations in a model development sample first (and perhaps as many as another 2,000 observations in a model testing sample.) There are three main reasons for this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>this is a project about what you learned in (431 and) 432, which is most definitely NOT a course in analyzing data with tens of thousands of observations,<br>
</li>
<li>avoid long waits while your data are processed in R, and 2000 is a good limit from this perspective.</li>
<li>be sure that things like a scatterplot are still of some value in terms of letting you understand your data. Scatterplots of more than about 1000 observations tend to be very difficult to interpret, even if they are quite large.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not worth boiling the ocean in this project. Of course, after the course is over, you can always ramp back up to a bigger version of the data set to expand the project.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the best way to select an appropriate set of predictors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends in part on the kind of question you are trying to answer. For most projects, we recommend a question that is explicitly about prediction, rather than either (a) trying to explain a phenomenon in existing data without reference to external prediction or (b) trying to make some sort of causal inference, which requires methods beyond the scope of this class.</p>
<p>We suggest you start with a question to answer, which should motivate specific predictors. A combination of logic, theory and prior empirical evidence is always preferable. A scan of the literature is always useful. A conceptual model of the relationship which makes predictions about what “should” happen under current understanding can be very helpful. We urge you to pick a project where you have some prior understanding of how the data will behave and where you can express that pre-modeling belief as part of your presentation of your work.</p>
<p>Don’t scan a list of correlations in the current data to see which ones look promising, and then forget that you did that when it comes time to evaluate the models. It’s fine to go on a fishing expedition in Project B, but then you have to severely temper your claims, an in particular you have to give up on drawing any substantial conclusions about causation or explanation and focus instead on a question about prediction, and (of course) validation of your model becomes essential.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Prior to analyses, should we specify our expected directions of relationships between outcomes and predictors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, especially for any key predictors.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Does Professor Love have a strong working understanding of genomics data?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Can we use <code>#| echo: false</code> in Project B?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of <code>#| echo: false</code> is prohibited in Project B. Use the template.</p>

<h1>Things We Want To See in Your Work</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>a clear statement of each of your research questions, preceded by an appropriate (but not at all lengthy) background section motivating those questions</li>
<li>a clear description of the data to be used, with careful attention to cleaning the data to make the follow-up analyses as straightforward as possible</li>
<li>the use of techniques from the 431-432 sequence for every stage of the data science process, from data ingest and tidying through the cycle of transformation, visualization and modeling, and then finally a careful communication of the end result</li>
<li>the use of regression methods that are directly applicable to the research questions you pose</li>
<li>the use of appropriate tools for diagnosing the quality of those models, including useful and well-presented visualizations and summary statistics</li>
<li>identification and comparison of candidate models to address your research questions if there are real choices to be made (if you have a clear model in mind at the start, there’s no need to artificially create a competitor)</li>
<li>validation of your model’s predictions and/or model summary statistics in an appropriate way</li>
<li>clear evidence that you have thought hard, and well, about what output to present. In particular, we want you to think in terms of creating meaningful annotations for every single scrap of output that you generate and present: if you cannot think of anything to say about a piece of output easily, why are you including it?</li>
<li>a clear re-statement of the research questions you asked at the start, now with conclusions that answer those questions</li>
<li>a clear statement of the limitations of your approach, and</li>
<li>a clear statement about useful next steps that you would like to try on the data, moving forward, as well as</li>
<li>a clear statement about what you learned as a result of doing the project.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this should appear in an extremely well-organized presentation and portfolio that work together well. Evidence of strong organization includes the use of effective labels, useful annotations for your code, and (in particular) meaningful headings and a helpful table of contents which make good use of the available technology.</p>

<li>How much data do you have, and what is the source of that data?</li>
<li>How did you deal with missing data, and what assumptions about missingness did you make?</li>

<li>Does your presentation focus on important issues? <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#the-presentation">See the list in the instructions</a>.</li>
<li>Have you avoided discussing statistical significance or any synonyms for that problematic term?</li>

<li>What does it mean for someone to be censored in your data?</li>
<li>What does a Kaplan-Meier curve describing survival across all of your outcomes, or perhaps comparing two or three key groups, tell us about your research question?</li>
<li>Why did you select the combination of predictors that you did for this model?</li>
<li>Have you provided an appropriate summary of the effects in your Cox model, and can you explain an effect to me that I select at random from your model appropriately without talking about statistical significance?</li>
<li>Overall, how well does your model fit, as judged by the unvalidated concordance, C statistic, and Cox-Snell R-square measure?</li>

<li>Why did you select the combination of predictors that you did for this model?</li>
<li>Which model(s) did you fit to your data? You should plan to fit at least two of a Poisson, a Negative Binomial and/or a zero-inflated model or hurdle model.</li>
<li>Why did you settle on the choice of count model you did? A comparison of rootograms is the most desirable way to show me how you made this choice.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>What is the outcome of interest, and is it an ordinal or nominal multi-categorical outcome? Did you do any collapsing of levels? Why? How many subjects are in your data overall, and within each level of your outcome?</li>
<li>Why did you select the combination of predictors that you did for this model?</li>
<li>What do the predictions from your model look like, when tabulated (in the rows) against the true results from your outcome (in the columns)? What does that table tell us about the accuracy of your predictions?</li>
<li>Use your model to make predictions for two new subjects, and use those predictions to discuss the impact of an interesting change in one of your more important predictors.</li>
</ol>
<p>and four additional questions, depending on whether you have an ordinal or nominal outcome…</p>
<p><strong>If you have an ordinal outcome</strong>, then I’d additionally ask:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>How are you making certain that R recognizes your outcome as an ordered factor?</li>
<li>Can you display and explain the <code>ggplot(Predict(yourmodel))</code> result from your POLR model (i.e.&nbsp;a lrm() model for a proportional outcome)?</li>
<li>How well does the POLR model fit, as judged by validated R-square and C statistics obtained through fitting with lrm()?</li>
<li>Which model did you wind up preferring for your data (POLR or multinomial) and why? (A likelihood ratio test along with AIC and BIC comparisons is a good option here.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you have a nominal outcome</strong>, then I would additionally ask:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>How do you know that your multinomial model converged?</li>
<li>How many intercepts and how many coefficients (slopes) are in your model? Do these values make sense in light of your outcome and predictors?</li>
<li>Can you display and explain the meaning of a plot of response probabilities describing the relationship between your outcome and one of your interesting categorical predictors?</li>
<li>Can you compare your model (which should have at least 2 predictors) to another model for your outcome that includes only one of your predictors (it’s up to you to decide what one predictor would be most interesting to study) using AIC, BIC and effective degrees of freedom, so that you can then tell us which of those two models looks best by both AIC and BIC?</li>
