The schedule for these presentations will be determined after completion of the Project B Proposal Form.\nPortfolio and Data You will then make changes (as needed) to your Quarto document (portfolio) in response to Professor Love’s comments during your presentation, and submit the final version of the portfolio along with a version of your data (as described here) to Canvas by the deadline in the Calendar.\n\n\nWorking with a Partner?\nYou can choose either to work alone, or with one other person, to complete Project B, unless Professor Love has specifically requested that you work alone. He will make those requests after Project A’s grading is complete.\nIf you are working with a partner…\n\nexactly one of you needs to complete the Project B Proposal Form (the other student should send an email to Dr. Love with the subject line 432 Project B Partnership confirming that you are working in a partnership and telling me the name of your partner), then\nyou will each participate in the Project B Presentation and the development of the Portfolio, and\n\nYour final Portfolio and Data will be submitted by exactly one of the two partners to Canvas while the non-reporting partner will submit a one-page note to Canvas indicating the members of the partnership and that the partner will submit the work."

    "text": "On Selecting Data\nWe hope that most people will find datasets of interest to them and use those. If you do not have any strong ideas for data to use, then we encourage you to consider the suggestions from 432 Project A. The best projects from my perspective use interesting and appropriate data that we have never seen before.\n\nYou must completely identify the source(s) of the data, so that Professor Love understands what data you are using very well, but you will not be required to share the data with him, or anyone else, if the data you use are not already available to the public. You must ensure that you have all necessary permission(s) to use the data for this course project.\nEach of your models must work with data drawn from the same tibble, and describe observations from the same pool of “subjects”.\nWe prefer that data sets contain between 200 and 2000 complete observations on each outcome, but you can use more than 2000 or as few as 150, if it’s important to do so. Projects with less than 150 subjects with complete data on all variables are not acceptable for Project B.\nYour tibble will need a subject identifying code, and each model must have a separate outcome, and at least one predictor not used in the other model and each model must have 2-8 predictors, we anticipate that your clean, tidied tibble will include between 6 and 19 variables.\nWe suggest that you collapse multiple categories as necessary to ensure that you have at least 25 observations in every category you plan to use for every predictor or outcome studied in Project B.\n\nUnlike 432 Project A, NHANES data are a completely acceptable choice for Project B, although we do require you to use the demographics file and at least two other NHANES files in developing your data set. See the Fall 2023 431 Project B instructions on Using NHANES data for more information on NHANES. If you use NHANES data or other large (weighted) survey data, you are welcome to do any or all of Project B without incorporating sampling weights.\nNote: We have had some difficulty identifying data set suggestions (outside of educational repositories like the UCI Machine Learning Repository) that are both messy enough to be interesting for this project and which also provide time-to-event outcomes with right censoring that are suitable for the survival analysis work we discuss in 432. If you have suggestions along these lines, we would be eager to hear them.\n\nThere are only a few restrictions on your choice of data.\n\nYou are not allowed to use data stored as a data set in any R package other than NHANES or Tidy Tuesday data.\nYou are not allowed to use data Professor Love or anyone else has provided to you for teaching purposes.\nYou cannot reuse the data you used in Project A for 432, although you can use a different data set to answer related questions. You are welcome to reuse data you used in your 431 project work if it is suitable and you haven’t used it in Project A for 432.\n\n\n\nNo multi-level (hierarchical) data\nWe want to powerfully discourage you from working with nested data that really require the use of multi-level models. The same rules set forward in Project A apply here, as well."

If you cannot think of anything to say about a piece of output easily, why are you including it?\n\nCleaning the data is a vitally important step. Professor Love will assume that you have done it perfectly. The TAs can help you, but this is your responsibility.\nYour cleaning should use tools from the tidyverse when possible, and you should do all analytic work on tibbles, whenever possible.\nDon’t include warnings or messages from R that we don’t need to know about.

Why did you select this approach, and how does it tie in with your research question?\nHow did you make certain that your binary outcome was being modeled in the direction you intend it to be modeled (i.e. the Probability of A happening, rather than the Probability of A not happening?)\nCan you demonstrate that you have fit the model properly, and evaluated it effectively using the tools we have developed in class?\nCan you demonstrate whether your model fits well, effectively using the tools available for you for the type of model you’re developing?\nHave you provided an appropriate summary of the effects in your model, and can you explain an effect to me that I select at random from your model appropriately without talking about statistical significance?\nCan you make predictions for new data using your model?\nCan you compare the performance of your model in a sensible way to an ordinary logistic regression model?\nCan you evaluate the assumptions that are relevant to your model?"

    "section": "What Makes a Data Set Acceptable?",
    "text": "What Makes a Data Set Acceptable?\n\nShared with the World. The data must be available to you, and shared with me and everyone else in the world (without any identifying information) as a well-tidied file by the time you submit your Project A Plan. If the data is from another source, the source (web or other) must be completely identified to me. Ongoing projects that require anyone’s approval to share data are not appropriate for Project A.\n\nYou should have the data in R by February 1, so that you will have sufficient time to complete the other elements of this Plan. Any data you cannot have by that time is a bad choice.\nFor Project A, you may not use any data set used in the 431 or 432 teaching materials.\nYou must use meaningfully different data sets in 432 Projects A and B.\nIn submitting your Project A Plan, you will need to be able to write “I am certain that it is completely appropriate for these data to be shared with anyone, without any conditions. There are no concerns about privacy or security.” So be sure that’s true before you pick a data set.\n\nSize.\n\nA minimum of 100 complete observations are required on each variable. It is fine if there are some missing values, as well, so long as there are at least 100 rows with complete observations on all variables you intend to use in each model.\nThe maximum data set size is 1200 observations, so if you have something larger than that, you’ll need to select a random subset of the available information as part of your data tidying process.\n\nOutcomes. The columns must include one quantitative outcome and one binary categorical outcome.\n\nWe prefer distinct outcomes, but if necessary, the binary outcome can be generated from the quantitative outcome (as an example, your quantitative outcome could be resting heart rate in beats per minute, and your binary outcome could be whether the resting heart rate is below 70 beats per minute.)\n\nInputs. You will need at least four regression inputs (predictors) for each of your two models.\n\nAt least one of the four must be quantitative (a variable is not quantitative for this purpose unless it has at least 10 different, ordered, observed values), and at least one must be multi-categorical (with between 3 and 6 categories, each containing a minimum of 30 subjects) for each model.\nYour other inputs can represent binary, multi-categorical or quantitative data.\nYou can examine different candidate predictors for each outcome, or use the same ones in both your linear and logistic regression models.\nDepending on your sample size, you can study more than the minimum number of regression inputs. See specifications below for your linear and logistic models.\n\n\nYour data need not be related to health, or medicine, or biology.\n\nNo hierarchical data\nIn each project this semester, we will require you to study cross-sectional data, where rows indicate subjects and columns indicate variables gathered to describe those subjects at a particular moment in time or space. Do not use “nested” data in Project A.\n\nOne example of hierarchical (nested) data would be a model of patient results that contains measures not just for individual patients but also measures for the providers within which patients are grouped, and also for health systems in which providers are grouped. That wouldn’t work for this project.\nAnother example of hierarchical (nested) data would be a model of individual people’s outcomes where the covariates are gathered at the state or county level, as well as at the level of individuals, and again, that doesn’t work for this project.\nThe singular exception to the “no hierarchical data” rule is that it will usually be acceptable for all inputs to be collected at a single (baseline) time point and both outcomes to be collected at a single future point in time. For example, you could predict systolic blood pressure in 2022 (or whether or not a subject’s systolic blood pressure in 2022 was below 140), based on a set of input variables (likely including systolic blood pressure) all gathered in 2021.\n\n\n\nJoining multiple data sets\nDr. Love will be especially impressed with a data collection effort that appropriately puts together at least two different data bases, should that be appropriate.\nWhat we have in mind are the following scenarios:\n\nMultiple data sets describing different variables for the same subjects that can be linked, so that you can build a combined data set with the same subjects but pulling together multiple sources of data, as, for example, the County Health Rankings do each year.\nMultiple data sets describing different subjects but the same variables, such as different years of a survey, combining, for instance, multiple iterations of NHANES so as to increase the available sample size.\n\nIf your project research questions and available data lead to one of these approaches, great. If not, don’t force it.\nThis may require you to learn something about the various joining commands, like left_join and inner_join that are highlighted in the Combine Data Sets section on the Data Transformation Cheat Sheet from Posit.\n\nWe heartily recommend Garret Grolemund’s YouTube materials on Data Wrangling, for instance this Introduction to Data Manipulation which is about combining multiple data sets.\nAnother great resource for combining data sets (and most of your other R questions) is the second edition of R for Data Science, by Wickham and Grolemund."

We will only accept those with really useful variables, no hierarchical structure and strong descriptions of how the data were gathered (which is at best 5% of what’s available on Kaggle). Don’t select a Kaggle data set without running it by us on Campuswire (see below) to see if we’re willing to let you use it.\nYou will not be permitted to use data from a textbook or other educational resource for learning statistics, data science or related methods (online or otherwise).\n\nExamples of such repositories (that are sadly out-of-bounds for this project and for 432 Project B) include the Cleveland Clinic Statistical Education dataset repository, the Vanderbilt University Biostatistics Datasets, or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n\nIt’s not a great idea to type “regression data sets” into Google - rarely does that lead to an interesting project."

The list of HTML “themes” that are available in Quarto by changing the “theme” option in the start of your document can be found here and we encourage you to pick something you think looks nice.\n\nTitle and Authors\nYour project should have a meaningful title (not containing the words “432” or “Project” or “Proposal” or “Plan”) but rather something describing your actual data and plans.\nPlease keep the main title to no more than 80 characters, including spaces. You can add a subtitle if you like, but the main title should stand on its own. Feel free to focus on one of your two research questions (rather than both) if that’s what’s needed to keep to the 80-character limit.\n\n\nR Packages and Setup\nYou’ll load necessary packages at the start in an unnumbered section of your work, following the template.\n\nDo not use source(\"Love-boost.R\") or any other R script or package unless you actually need something it provides.\nDo not load core elements of tidyverse or tidymodels separately. instead just load the meta-packages, and do so last.\nUse #| message: false as part of your Quarto code chunk where the packages are listed (as we have done in the template) to eliminate HTML messages about when packages were built or how objects were masked.\n\n\n\n1. Data Source\nProvide complete information on the source of the data: how did you get it, how was it gathered, by whom, in what setting, for what purpose, and using what sampling strategy.\nThis small section should include a clear link (with all necessary details) to the URL which we can use to obtain the raw data freely.\n\n\n2. The Subjects\nA description (one or two sentences should be sufficient) of who or what the subjects (rows) are in your data set, and how they were sampled from the population of interest.\n\n\n3. Loading and Tidying the Data\n\n3.1 Loading the Raw Data\nProvide code to ingest the raw data. Ideally, this should use tidyverse-friendly code and a direct link to the URL where the data are housed online.\n\n\n3.2 Cleaning the Data (involves several subsections)\nTidy and clean up the data to meet all necessary requirements for your modeling work. This will require multiple sub-sections as you tackle different tasks for different sets of variables. Use the tidyverse for data management whenever possible. Some of things you need to do here…\n\nEliminate all variables that are not going to be used (either as identifiers, outcomes or inputs) in your planned analyses.\nChange variable names to more meaningful ones, although it’s helpful to keep them at 10 characters or less. Use clean_names() from the janitor package to clean up and standardize the presentation of variable names.\nSample the data as needed to ensure that you meet the data set size specifications (no more than 1200 rows, for instance.)\nConvert all variables to appropriate types (factors, etc.) as needed, and complete appropriate checks of the values for all variables.\nIf you have prospective inputs (predictors) that are multi-categorical with more than 6 categories, collapse them to six or fewer categories in a rational way at this stage.\nEnsure that all categorical variables have at least 30 observations at each level, collapsing or removing levels as needed to accomplish this end.\nYour tidied data set should be arranged with a row (subject) identifier at the far left. That identifier should have a unique value for each row, and should be saved as a character variable in R.\nWe expect your final tibble to have some missing values. Do not impute or delete these, but do be sure they are correctly identified as missing values by R.\nDo not list the entire tibble or print out large strands of R output (like summaries of the entire tibble) anywhere in your document, except where you are required by these instructions to do so.\n\n\n\n\n4. The Tidy Tibble\n\n4.1 Listing the Tibble\nIn this section, you should start by listing the tibble you created in Section 3, with all variables correctly imported (via your code) as the types of variables (factor/integer/numeric, etc.) that you need for modeling.\n\nThis should be a listing, not a glimpse or anything else. Just type in the name of your tibble.\nThe resulting list should be limited to the first 10 rows of your data.\n\n\n\n4.2 Size and Identifiers\nWrite a sentence specifying the number of rows and the number of columns in your tibble, and this should match the R output.\nThen identify the name of the variable that provides the identifier for each row in your tidy tibble, and demonstrate that each row has a unique value for that variable, and that the variable is represented as a character in R.\n\nOne way to do this is to run the n_distinct function from the dplyr package on this particular variable.\nDo not present summary or descriptive results on every variable in the whole tibble here - you’ll do that in Section 5.\n\n\n\n4.3 Save the tidied Tibble as an .Rds file\nNow, save the tidied data set as an .Rds file (using write_rds or the equivalent), which you’ll need to submit to us. The tibble should have the same name as the data file you submit to Canvas.\n\n\n\n5. The Code Book\n\n5.1 Defining the Variables\nIn this section, provide a beautiful codebook which tells us (at a minimum) the following information for each variable in the tibble you printed and saved in Section 4.\n\nThe name of the variable in your tibble.\nThe role of the variable in your planned analyses (options include identifier, outcome, or input)\nThe type of variable for each outcome or input (options are categorical, in which case tell us how many categories, or quantitative)\nA short description of the meaning of the variable.\n\nThis should include the units of measurement if the variable is quantitative, and a list of the possible values if the variable is categorical.\n\n\nAs an example, here’s a part of a simple table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nRole\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsubjectID\nidentifier\n-\ncharacter code for subjects\n\n\nsysbp\noutcome\nquant\nMost Recent Systolic Blood Pressure, in mm Hg\n\n\nstatin\ninput\n2-cat\nHas a current statin prescription? (Yes or No)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Numerical Description\nHere, run the describe command from the Hmisc package on your entire tibble. Be sure that the results match up with what you’ve described in defining the variables, and that the same variables appear, in the same order, in the codebook and in these results.\n\n\n\n6. Linear Regression Plans\n\n6.1 My First Research Question\nBegin this section by specifying a question that you hope to answer with the linear model you are proposing. A research question relates clearly to the data you have and your modeling plans, and, like all questions, it ends with a question mark. Eventually, you will need to answer this question in your portfolio.\nJeff Leek in his book “How to be a Modern Scientist” has some excellent advice in his section on “How Do You Start a Paper.” In particular, you want to identify research questions that:\n\nare concrete, (and for which you can find useful data), and that\nsolve a real problem, and that\ngive you an opportunity to do something new,\nthat you will feel ownership of, and\nthat you want to work on.\n\nWe recommend you use the FINER criteria (or, if relevant, the PICOT criteria) to help you refine a vague notion of a research question into something appropriate for this project.\n\nFINER = Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical and Relevant.\nPICOT is often used in medical studies assessing or evaluating patients and includes Patient (or Problem), Intervention (or Indicator), Comparison group, Outcomes and Time.\n\nThe Wikipedia entry on research questions provides some helpful links to these ideas.\n\n\n6.2 My Quantitative Outcome\nThis subsection tells us what you will use your linear regression model to explain or predict.\n\nTell us the name in the tibble of the linear regression outcome you will use (this should the quantitative outcome you identified in your Codebook) and state why you are interested in predicting this variable.\nProvide a count of the number of rows in your data with complete information on this outcome.\nProvide a nicely labeled graphical summary of the distribution of your outcome to supplement the numerical description you provided in Section 5.2.\nComment briefly on the characteristics of the outcome’s distribution. Is your outcome skewed or symmetric, is it discrete or fairly continuous, is there a natural transformation to consider?\nDemonstrate that the variable you have selected meets the standard for a quantitative variable used in this Project, specifically that it has at least 10 different, ordered, observed values.\n\n\n\n6.3 My Planned Predictors (Linear Model)\nNow, tell us precisely which four (or more) candidate predictors (inputs) you intend to use for your linear regression model.\n\nPlease use the variable names that appear in your code book and tibble.\nDemonstrate to us that you have at least one input which is quantitative, specifically that it has at least 10 different, ordered, observed values.\nDemonstrate to us that you have at least one categorical input which has between 3 and 6 categories, that will be used as a factor in your modeling, and that has at least 30 observations in each level of the factor. If necessary, you can create such a predictor from a quantitative one, but if you are doing this, remember that only the multi-categorical version of the predictor should be included in your models.\nDemonstrate that the total number of candidate predictors you suggest is no more than \\(4 + (N_1 - 100)/100\\), rounding down, where \\(N_1\\) is the number of rows with complete outcome data in your tibble.\n\nYou should close this section by briefly specifying your guesses as to the expected direction of relationships between your outcome and your predictors.\n\n\n\n7 Logistic Regression Plans\n\n7.1 My Second Research Question\nBegin this section by specifying a question that you hope to answer with the logistic model you are proposing. A research question relates clearly to the data you have and your modeling plans, and, like all questions, it ends with a question mark. Eventually, you will need to answer this question in your portfolio.\nSee section 6.1 for some more suggestions about improving your research questions.\n\n\n7.2 My Binary Outcome\nThis subsection tells us what you will use your logistic regression model to explain or predict.\n\nTell us the name in the tibble of the logistic regression outcome you will use (this should be the binary (2-category) outcome you identified in your codebook) and state why you are interested in predicting this variable.\nProvide a count of the number of rows in your data with each of the two possible values of this outcome. Indicate whether you have any missing values.\n\n\n\n7.3 My Planned Predictors (Logistic Model)\nNow, tell us precisely which four (or more) candidate predictors you intend to use for your logistic regression model.\n\nIf you are using some of the same predictors as in your linear regression model, there’s no need to repeat yourself. Simply tell us which variables you’ll use again, and then provide descriptions for any new predictors that did not appear in your plans for the linear model.\nDemonstrate that the total number of candidate predictors you suggest for your logistic regression model is no more than \\(4 + (N_2 - 100)/100\\) predictors, rounded down, where \\(N_2\\) is the number of subjects in the smaller of your two outcome groups.\n\nYou should close this section by briefly specifying your guesses as to the expected direction of relationships between your outcome and your predictors.\n\n\n\n8 Affirmation\nNext you need to affirm that the data set meets all of the project requirements, especially that the data can be shared freely over the internet, and that there is no protected information of any kind involved.\nThe text we want to see here is\n\nI am certain that it is completely appropriate for these data to be shared with anyone, without any conditions. There are no concerns about privacy or security.\n\nIf you are unsure as to whether this is true, select a different data set.\n\n\n9 References\nReferences (you’ll need one to describe the source of your data, at least) go here.\n\n\n10 Session Information\nPlease provide session information by running xfun::session_info().\n\nxfun::session_info()\n\nR version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31 ucrt)\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64\nRunning under: Windows 11 x64 (build 22631)\n\nLocale:\n  LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8 \n  LC_CTYPE=English_United States.utf8   \n  LC_MONETARY=English_United States.utf8\n  LC_NUMERIC=C                          \n  LC_TIME=English_United States.utf8    \n\nPackage version:\n  base64enc_0.1.3   bslib_0.8.0       cachem_1.1.0      cli_3.6.3        \n  compiler_4.4.2    digest_0.6.37     evaluate_1.0.1    fastmap_1.2.0    \n  fontawesome_0.5.3 fs_1.6.5          glue_1.8.0        graphics_4.4.2   \n  grDevices_4.4.2   highr_0.11        htmltools_0.5.8.1 htmlwidgets_1.6.4\n  jquerylib_0.1.4   jsonlite_1.8.9    knitr_1.49        lifecycle_1.0.4  \n  memoise_2.0.1     methods_4.4.2     mime_0.12         R6_2.5.1         \n  rappdirs_0.3.3    rlang_1.1.4       rmarkdown_2.29    rstudioapi_0.17.1\n  sass_0.4.9        stats_4.4.2       tinytex_0.54      tools_4.4.2      \n  utils_4.4.2       xfun_0.49         yaml_2.3.10"

    "text": "Outline of the Presentation\nYour presentation should include fewer than 10 slides.\nYour “most important finding” is just going to be one of many potentially interesting findings in your Project. Your job in the presentation is not to prove to me that you did a lot of work - I’ll see that in the portfolio.\nInstead, your job in the presentation is to interest your audience in something you found that is (at least relatively) important. You are expected to help us understand the following things related to your most important finding, based on either a linear or logistic model.\nYou will not be developing any new material for the slides (just restating and rearranging things you’ve already done and perhaps constructing a short narrative to help us retain your key findings) once you have the portfolio. As a result, we encourage you to complete the portfolio first.\nWe suggest you develop about 8 slides. This should include…\n\nA title slide\nA couple of slides to describe the Subjects, Outcome and Predictors\n\nMake sure we understand who the subjects are, how they were selected, what the outcome is and why we should care about it, and what predictors are involved in the model you’ll show.\n\nSeveral slides showing meaningful statistical findings (What should we learn from your model?)\n\nWhat does the model (don’t show us details of multiple models in the presentation) say about the relationship between the outcome and the predictors?\nYou’re only showing us one model (of models A, B, Y and Z) in the presentation.\nHow well does this model fit the data you have, and how well might it fit in new data?\n\nA couple of slides discussing next steps\n\nIt is unlikely that you’ll have a model that is truly satisfactory all on its own, so what could be done to improve it that you cannot already do with the data you have? What other data could be collected, how could the measures be refined, could you design a study to get to a more convincing answer?\n\n\nMake sure that you introduce yourself when you start to speak, over your title slide if you are working alone. We’re happy to see your face during the presentation, but this isn’t mandatory. If you are working with a partner, each of you should introduce yourself at the beginning, and let me know who’s speaking first.\n(Essentially) every word and every image/table/chart in your slides can and should come directly from the materials contained in your HTML portfolio.\n\nThe development of the presentation is mostly about selecting useful information to present and then arranging it in a way that sticks for your audience.\nYour presentation should include no R code but instead will provide nicely formatted figures and tables along with text. Some figures don’t work well on slides, like nomograms, without a lot of work. Pick something that is both useful and easy to see.\nEach slide should have a title, indicating the message you want us to get from the slide (don’t use generic titles like “Results” or “Table 1”).\nYou’ll have to cut out around 95% of your portfolio to create your slides, and you should follow your instincts regarding your audience (Professor Love, the TAs and your fellow students are your audience.)\nDeveloping the presentation is where you have to make decisions about what’s most important to show an audience to get them interested in your work. That’s a critically important skill."

Sensible graphs to accomplish this task in a multivariate regression model include the ggplot with Predict combination, the plot(summary()) approach, and/or a nomogram."

    "text": "Variable Selection\n\nWhat is the best way to select an appropriate set of predictors?\n\nIt depends in part on the kind of question you are trying to answer. For most projects, I recommend a question that is explicitly about prediction, rather than either (a) trying to explain a phenomenon in existing data without reference to external prediction or (b) trying to make some sort of causal inference, which requires methods beyond the scope of this class.\nWhat I would always try to do is start with a question I want to answer, which should motivate specific predictors. A combination of logic, theory and prior empirical evidence is always preferable. A scan of the literature is always useful. A conceptual model of the relationship which makes predictions about what “should” happen under current understanding can be very helpful. I strongly urge you to pick a project where you have some prior understanding of how the data will behave and where you can express that pre-modeling belief as part of your presentation of your work.\nWhat I would definitely not do is scan a list of correlations in the current data to see which ones look promising, and then forget that I did that when it came time to evaluate the models I developed. It’s fine to go on a fishing expedition here, but then you have to severely temper your claims, and in particular you have to give up on drawing any substantial conclusions about causation or explanation and focus instead on a question about prediction, and (of course) validation of your model becomes essential."
